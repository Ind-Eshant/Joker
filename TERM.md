# 🌐 Terms of Service  
**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025  

Welcome to the AI Image Generation Bot! By using this bot, you agree to the following terms.  
We're chill, but there are rules — even for you, Picasso.

---

## 1. 🎨 Purpose of the Bot  
This bot lets you generate images using artificial intelligence — responsibly, creatively, and respectfully.

---

## 2. ✅ What You Can Do
- Use the bot in public or private Discord servers  
- Generate images for fun, projects, inspiration, or memes  
- Share creations (as long as they follow Discord and community guidelines)

- Abuse the system by spamming, overloading, or trying to break the bot  
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, exploit, or misuse the bot in any way  
- Pretend you made the bot (we’ll know 👀)

If you violate these, you may be blacklisted from using the bot — forever, with no cookie.

## 4. ⚖️ Bot Availability  
The bot is provided “as is.” We may update, remove, or shut it down without notice — but we’ll usually keep it running like a loyal sidekick.

---

## 5. ❌ Blacklisting & Termination  
We reserve the right to deny access to users who:
- Abuse the bot or API  
- Violate these Terms  
- Just give off bad vibes 💀

## 6. 🧠 Intellectual Property  
You’re free to use your generated images however you like — we don’t claim ownership. But the prompts you use may affect the style/output.
