Creating art with Joker is simple and uses intuitive slash commands.

The Commands
The core command is **/create**, which is used to generate your image. For instance, you would type **/create** prompt: "A sleek silver robot sitting on a throne, dramatic lighting, 8k cinematic". To get a random, unique image that sparks inspiration, use **/chaos**. If you ever need a list of all the bot's tricks and available commands, just use **/help**.

Prompting for Perfection (or glorious madness)
To get the best results from Joker, be specific with your descriptions. The AI can only draw what you describe! Always specify the desired style (e.g., "vaporwave," "low poly," "pencil sketch," or "isometric"). Boost the quality by including terms like "4k," "highly detailed," or "trending on ArtStation."
